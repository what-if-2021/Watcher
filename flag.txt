The night began like a glitch in time, a hum beneath the static, a faint flicker in every streetlight at once. The town of Wraithmoor lay still, wrapped in a silence that felt programmed, as if someone had muted the world. Somewhere deep below the wires and walls, an ancient signal pulsed again. It had slept for years, buried in forgotten code, until Halloween night—the night when the veil always faltered. No one remembered when the first echo had been heard, but everyone remembered the cold it left behind—a chill that seeped not through bricks, but through bandwidth.
At the end of Main Street stood the old computer lab, abandoned since 1999. Its windows were cracked, dust swirling like ghosts in the moonlight. Every October 31st, without fail, the server lights inside blinked back to life. There was no electricity, no generator—only a steady, mechanical heartbeat that seemed to rise from nowhere. The locals swore they heard typing after midnight: keys clicking like bones tapping on glass. The sound always stopped if you listened too hard, as though whatever made it could sense attention. They called the building The Wayback Machine, but not the one on the internet. This one was older—hungrier.
Inside, the air was metallic and dry, the smell of static heavy in every breath. Tangled cables ran across the floor like veins, pulsing faintly with unseen current. Monitors were coated in layers of dust, yet their screens glowed dimly with the persistence of something that refused to die. One screen blinked with a faded prompt: ENTER PASSWORD TO RESTORE. No one had ever passed that point. Until now.
A group of four students—curious, reckless, and bored—decided to find out what the machine really hid. Their leader, Mira, carried her laptop like a torch, the light from its screen illuminating her pale face. “We find the source,” she said, “we find the legend.” Her friends—Ash, Dev, and Lina—laughed nervously, but none of them turned back. The lab door groaned as they pushed it open. Inside, dust motes floated in the glow of their flashlights, dancing like lost data fragments in the dark.
Rows of ancient computers lined the walls, their cases yellowed and cracked. The hum grew louder, vibrating through the floor. One of the machines booted itself, letters crawling across its green screen: INITIALIZING… RESTORING SESSION: 31/10/1999. Ash frowned. “How can it still work?” he whispered. Mira didn’t answer. Her eyes were fixed on the center terminal—the one that wasn’t covered in dust. She brushed her fingers over the keyboard. It was warm. Too warm.
The system blinked again: RUNNING RECALL PROTOCOL. Then came a string of strange characters, repeating faster and faster. Lina stepped back, uneasy. “Maybe we should unplug it.” Mira didn’t move. “What if it’s trying to tell us something?” The speakers crackled. A faint whisper leaked through—distorted, metallic, and yet unmistakably human. “Do you remember us?” it said. Another whisper followed: “We remember you.”
The walls began to hum. The floorboards shuddered. Dev’s flashlight flickered violently. And in that moment, every screen in the room displayed the same phrase, glowing white through static:

Her breath hitched as the letters seemed to burn into her retinas. “That’s it,” she muttered. “That’s what it was hiding.” But the others had gone silent. Their faces were pale, their eyes wide. On every monitor, their reflections appeared—but none of them were moving. The reflections smiled, even though they did not.
A voice rose through the speakers again—childlike, but layered with distortion. “You found the key,” it sang softly, “but the door is still open.” The monitors flickered, showing glimpses of unfamiliar rooms—hallways with peeling wallpaper, candlelit desks, faces pressed too close to the camera. The building seemed to breathe around them.
Mira slammed her laptop shut, but the sound didn’t stop. Instead, her own screen came alive, glowing with lines of unfamiliar code. RUN TRACE: ORIGIN = MIRROR_NETWORK_1999. The air felt heavier now, like the room itself was compressing around them. Lina grabbed Mira’s arm. “We need to go.” But the door they had entered was gone—just a wall of flickering static where the frame used to be. Ash stepped forward, trembling. “Maybe… it’s not real.” He reached out to touch the static, and his hand passed through like smoke. When he pulled it back, his skin shimmered faintly, as though made of pixels. He didn’t scream—he just stared, silent, while his hand dissolved into the air, line by line.
The monitors dimmed. The whisper grew louder. “You shouldn’t have come back.”
Dev stumbled toward the center terminal, trying to shut it down. The keyboard burned under his touch, the letters melting into symbols. On the screen, a countdown appeared. 00:59… 00:58… “It’s a failsafe!” he shouted. “We triggered something!” Mira’s eyes darted around the room, searching for a way out. Then she saw it—a small note taped to the main monitor, yellowed with age. The handwriting was shaky: Once restored, never shut down. They live in the recall.
The clock hit 00:00. Every screen went black.
For a moment, there was only silence—then a long, electric sigh. The lights flickered once more, then steadied. The room was empty. The computers sat idle. The students were gone.
Across town, in the dim light of her apartment, a young girl scrolled through an old archive website. The banner read Wayback Archive — Halloween Restoration Log. She clicked on the latest entry, uploaded just minutes ago. A video loaded—grainy footage of a dark room, four figures moving through it, their faces flickering in and out of focus. The feed ended abruptly, replaced by the familiar phrase: She blinked. “Weird,” she murmured, refreshing the page. The timestamp changed to the current time—one second ago. Another line appeared beneath the flag: New connection detected: USER ONLINE. Her webcam light flicked on.
Outside, the streetlights glitched again. Somewhere in the distance, the faint sound of typing echoed—bones on glass, steady and deliberate. And far away, in the ruins of the old computer lab, a single monitor blinked back to life.
